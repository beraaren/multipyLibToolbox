# Multi-Purpose Code Repository

This repository was created to streamline frequently used code snippets and functions, making them easily accessible and organized. Over time, the repetitive process of recreating and searching for functions had made development cluttered and time-consuming. To address this, this repository provides categorized functions and utilities that can be searched and reused efficiently. It also allows you to contribute by adding your own functions through pull requests.

While each function could be adjusted for individual projects, including extensive setups and modules (`__init__.py`, `setup.py`) isn't necessary for occasional use cases, saving both time and effort. Even minor code reuse can help reduce repetitive work and increase efficiency.

## Getting Started (for user)

1. using whith pip :

   ```bash
   pip install https://github.com/beraaren/multipyLibToolbox.git
   ```
2. You can now import

   ```
   import multipyLibToolbox as tbx
   tbx.selenium_tbx # Ã¶rnek nesne
   ```

## Getting Started (for devoloper)

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beraaren/multipyLibToolbox.git
   cd multi-purpose-code-repo
   ```
2. Explore the categories and locate the function you need. Use the general search feature within the repo to find specific functions quickly.
3. For your custom functions, create a pull request to contribute to this repository.

## Key Features

## FAQ

### Why not make each function into a separate module or package?

Since these functions are often used infrequently, creating full setups for each one would add unnecessary complexity. This repository focuses on accessibility and ease of use, rather than creating standalone packages.

### How can I contribute my functions?

Simply fork this repository, add your function in the appropriate category, and create a pull request. Your function will be reviewed and, if accepted, added to the main repository.

### What if I can't find the function I need?

Try using the general search feature in this repository. If you still can't find what you're looking for, consider creating it and contributing to the repository for future users.

### Is there a specific format for functions?

While there is no strict format, functions should be well-commented and should include a brief description at the top explaining their purpose. This makes it easier for others to understand and use them.

### Can I use this code for commercial purposes?

The licensing details for each function are listed at the top of the respective file. Please ensure that you adhere to these when using the code in commercial projects.
